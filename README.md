# RaceHub - A Calendar Manager for Motorsport

Honestly, I'll probably never finish this. I think it's a good idea, but if I were to finish it, I would probably start over and change my approach. There is some good stuff in there though, even if it is unorganized and nearly completely undocumented. 

## Features

- View upcoming events for every series you care about, all on one convenient homepage.
- View upcoming and past events for any single series on its own page. 
- Timezone localization! Event/session times are stored as UTC and are automatically converted to whichever timezone the user is in.
- A settings page to modify the app appearance and choose the series (and indiviual sessions) you care about.
- Dark Mode!
- A really cool (but sadly non-functional) form for submitting calendar changes for review.
- JSON file management (I guess this is a feature?).

## Unfinished/Unimplmented Features

- A way to modify the calendars. The form is there, but it doesn't do anything.
- API calendar management for the larger series who actually have APIs.
- Full settings functionality (some preferences don't properly save, but dark mode works!).
- Cloud storage using NoSQL through Google Firebase (instead of local JSON).
